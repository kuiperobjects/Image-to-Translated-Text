in the case of this study was the painter Paavo Pyhtilä was born in 1927. He drew

Literature has been a civil school and two-year vocational school Paavo fermentation in the main Pyhtilä
art educator. He read his hometown library of art books so carefully that the librarian began
to lend him a hand in the library books. Pyhtilä received books as gifts from relatives and colleagues and commissioned
them through the bookstore since the 1950s. He read the book carefully underlining and notes

foreign language books were important points of comparison despite a lack of language skills.

Self-taught Kaan does not learn alone. He needs encouragement and guidance. Paavo Pyhtilä applied for - at the beginning of his career
- other artists' comments: Raahe Seminars Leo Heng, Unto Immonen, Eero Sovelius-Sovio,
Oulu, Matti Mikkola, a co-worker Paavo Kauko Salo, the first intermediary Esko Roihu, Cooperative Society

creativity and freedom is the fact that alongside the journey as equal partners also repeated

Tampere leaves also wrote a very exhibitions. It was sort of some sort of breakthrough,
as afterward one critic wrote. However, it is not risen your enthusiasm, but I felt
still a novice and I took very humbly doing. * 9?

[1975] The criticism is harsh in Helsinki, but that's where it gets to learn. Yes I think every tissue

the piireistä.683

[1979] The critics I have begun to react logically. Their criticism of the saw is always, however,
one person's perception and many times these staff projections will go entirely to the cross. Road-
course, it has happened that all the time to grow your own self-criticism. Have to rely on themselves. No criticism
According to paint, it is too haphazard, Paavo Pyhtilä says. - - Yes criticism to give

[1981] - Paris once again makes the mind, I have not been there for eight years. There is
the chance to see so many old and new, the world's different puolilta.?*!

About Paavo relationship Pyhtilä, above all, Paris has been described by others lehtiar-
particle, but before I give the word Paavo Pyhtilä, I quote his
the above recommended books, perhaps the best-known Finnish artist novels, Paavo
Rintala's work God is Beauty, in which the artist ponders the first Pariisin-

journey like this:

"A band of artists have advised her most important art museums.

After that, he is no longer comrades longed for.

What are those, comrades, nothing more than the cost of money. She walks every day for long distance

unnecessarily color. That, too, is expensive here. Here are all expensive. You should be careful and be

3.1. Art World

have to get in order to become "true artist". George Dickie ( "art world")
Pierre Bourdieu ( "art field") are those investigators, which refers to the much salt

artists, work as part of the future of art education.

It should be remembered that the artist does not usually give rise to. Effective preparation
artist seems impossible. It is - Paavo Pyhtilä way - to live the kind of
life, which become an artist. If an artist input would be a breeze with bare training
lumaisin means, would be needed more artists who have not attended schools produce.
They would create works of what is there and what is there that
through education and training. And the artist must not rush to prepare for an artist, because
if he is ready, he prevents their own development. He can only learn by trial and error

ITE art of writing in Helena Sederholm has separated the professional, amateur
distribution and contemporary folk artists. According to him, the artist is a profession of the person,
that manages many aspects of the art, has studied engineering in addition to art history
riaa and theory, as well as acts as a full-time profession, whereas art connoisseur

is part of the free time, "second life", an escape from everyday life:
"For an artist, art is not another life, but a life."

A professional artist can be accessed through its position as art education or art world, aims to
to support themselves through art, keep the expression of ideas and the importance of doing their job
for the public; amateur artist makes art for his own pleasure, even if it strives
artistic outcome; contemporary folk artist does not want boundaries of the art world
of the inside and not even try to make "art to give a spectacular art," but he expresses

Bruno S. Frey and Werner W. Pommerehne compare eight different criteria
to define the artist: 1) the time spent on artistic work, 2) taiteellises-
of the amount of income from the activities, 3) the artist's reputation among the general public, 4)
Suomaa recognition by other artists, 5) the quality of the artistic work (when the artistic
of the 'quality' must be somehow defined), 6) of the artist groups or organizations
membership, 7) vocational qualifications (degrees art schools), and 8) subjective

good questions:

"What, after all, is considered as belonging to the artist's work? Can only the so-called. Free artists

Sari Karttunen 2006 is pondering it, why artists choose to years of training

resistance can be a valuable artistry ancillary (eg. teaching) related to work,
which is funded by visual artists for creative activities. Karttunen also assume that
young artists - having faced fierce competition - seek out to continue their studies

3.3. Work of art)

George Dickie definition of a work of art is presented in such a Finnish:

"Classifying the meaning of Art is (1) an artifact, and (2) a plurality aspect, one of which
or some particular social institution (the art world) persons have conceded the position the potential
AS A subject of the valuation. " '"?

The artist, therefore, participate consciously and purposefully work of art making and -

In spite of coincidences - the whole work of art is not an arbitrary 74!.

Karttunen's view, it is better to define the art of the artist as an artist committed by
art factor, and he says the art - in spite of the field battles - to remain

deeply valuable, instead of "good art" is being constantly disagree! "5. carrier

176

tokorven believes that the viewer should not be interpreted as a work of art / ", which in a broad sense can

be anything, what looks aesthetic point of view! "". The artist makes
works to continue searching for the result: it develops, he wishes to express its already-called

but still they too were originally made for display in a. the value of some of the works of power

major exhibition does not fit in Raahe ". The exhibition foreword to the publication Soili Lankia,
The town of Raahe Cultural Affairs at the time, summed up in the following Paavo Pyhtilä career

accordingly;

[1987] In a remote small town artist has not been kind comrades. In fact, must apply for doctrine,
its influences and its impetus - sometimes from far and wide. For years the artist to find an understanding viewer
only self-criticism and self-criticism is the only species that is on offer.

Under these conditions, it is prudent to start. Paavo Pyhtilä painting had long been rarely,
Subha, which gradually took the man, filled all his spare time and eventually in 1968 became heads for the night.

35 years of production sees how the artist is looking for, try and realize - the changes are not
sudden, but the former will always result in a new thread.

Paavo Pyhtilä started at the beginning of the 1950s with paintings, whose spirit found in the Finnish 1940
joyless and heavy Expressionism.

1960 was the number-time experimentation of fabrics glowing with new bright colors, the special material
aalikokeilut displaced by the oil. at the end of the decade, Pyhtilä jobs characteristic clarity, tarkkara-
jaisuus and the surface breakdown of geometric came here to stay.

The 1970s saw a series of konkretistisia paintings, the subject of which disappeared completely and the color
the shape of the road. Colors buckled, sointuivat and the shape was simplified. After a few years from now
Subjects returned, got the Raahe wooden setting a new expression, which is a loan early twentieth century
cubists.

1970 was a series of narrative pictures, interspersed with events, seasons and, opposites
characteristics. Restlessness held together by a low-key color harmony.

As early as the 1960s, fascinated by the surrealistic topics Pyhtilä and surrealist him now is to be kept
minimum effort. The paintings can be found in autiutta scary, strange beaches, derelict structures and shadows
human orphan hood. But also a lot of humor, some original insights and thrown to the viewer
puzzles.

A few years ago the paintings of people lost their face, became unrecognizable
forces into particles. Images crept into melancholy, hopeful, however, that illuminates the coloring, and the way that the sample
that always take somewhere.

As early as next painting can not tell you what sitten.?*?

In 1982, appeared in the book Pusa, Unto: Art festivals, supplied by Päivi Lahtela and public

Perhaps the effect of Pusan ​​Unto ABC teaching courses, and even 1993, stated:

[1993] Pyhtilä modern paintings is characterized by the production of multi-level symbolism humorous,
quiet, stagnant atmosphere, clear, often in pastels color fields and a tight infrastructure.
The pattern is a reflection of Unto Pusa cubist principles of composition. So Pyhtilä

In 1981, Paavo Pyhtilä was a founding artist of Raahe Follow, follow

Stated on an equal footing.

[1998] One of the case yet in 1982 [po 1981]. The county and the Arts Council of Finland
Artists' Society was organized in Oulu subject of painters advanced training course for public spaces
murals. I applied for the course, and I was able to. It happened three week course at the University of Oulu
premises and in the meantime had assignments at home. Raimo Heino was the leader of one of Helsinki. Job
The final exhibition of the Art Museum of Oulu [from 08.08.1981]. At least for me there was a lot of new
to learn. It was good that I came to. There were also sculptors area of ​​their own public

on the basis of the draft "Toad" Fountain. "**?

[2007] after the one person who has been palio support and from whom I have received advice and guidance, is
sculptor and graphic artist Raimo Forest Tribe Oulu. He is a, a real, qualified art element
in their place - - and we were samolla painter jatkokoulutuskurssillaki sometimes ... hmm ... almost 20

Although Paavo Pyhtilä has repeatedly stated that, "An artist can not be taught"

is he not produce further training course, 16 years later memoirs kirjates-
I find, therefore, wrote: "At least for me there was a lot of new things to learn was a good thing.
that the fire had left, "implying there taught good techniques:

[1979] SpongeBob Pyhtilä says that an artist can not be anyone to teach by teaching. Study itself is
important, the technique can be learned. - But it's something, yes it is every self-struggle and
to evolve. 550

[1984] The second point I would like to intervene in the case when talking about the painter, is a technology management.
It is, after all, only what can be taught. But the learning is very important.
It is a large entity which has been written hundreds of pages of books. "

To my question, whether an artist to learn, said Paavo Pyhtilä that few have so
great natural gifts, that "all realize and understand everything, iliman unlearned"
that is, an artist tricky to learn. Have to start drawing from the basics and development
use in himself: "you learn to color, art history, it is the a and o It is important." And in addition will
explore the works of art, to visit museums, exhibitions, to compare the works of their own and others
works and thus to obtain confirmation uskollensa. The artist fits Paavo according Pyhtilä
not to teach another artist, such as "noisa academies - - they have been ite
Art studies in the end, have made the already good art frequently ku before they are selected
